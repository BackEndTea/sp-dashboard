<p>Documentation about this SP registration form can be found at:
<a href=\"https://wiki.surfnet.nl/x/isZWAw\">https://wiki.surfnet.nl/x/isZWAw</a>.</p>

<p>The registration of your Service Provider consists of two parts. A contractual and technical part. This form covers the technical part. The contractual part will be handled by SURFmarket.
In the following pages we will ask you to submit the necessary information that allows us to create a test connection. With the following details ready we estimate this process will take around 20 minutes to complete. Information we need and collect through this form includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various contacts responsible for the entity. Support, administrative and technical
should be present.</li>
<li>Information about SAML 2.0 configuration.</li>
<li>Metadata information including URL, certificate and logo of your entity.</li>
<li>A list of the attributes your Service Provider requires to operate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Publish</strong>
When all fields are filled in correctly you can publish the configuration to the SURFconext test environment. The service will be available directly for testing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update</strong>
The configuration can be modified whenever you see fit. Just change the fields, press 'update' and 'confirm'. The changes are available instantenously.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Production</strong>
When tests are successful you can request a production connection. Simply press the button 'to production' to initiate this process.
<strong>Note:</strong> your service can get production status only if the required contracts are in place.
</p>

<p>If there are any questions during completion of the form donâ€™t hesitate to mail to support@surfconext.nl. Please add the ticket number to the subject (CXT-...).</p>

<p>Every service connected to SURFconext requires various types of contact details. Depending on the nature of the issue we will consult the following contact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative</li>
<li>Technical</li>
<li>Support</li>
</ul>
<p>See the question mark for a more extensive description. Possibly some information below already has been filled through the metadata. Please check the fields and edit when necessary.</p>

<p>When an end-user logs in to your SP, SURFconext sends a SAML-assertion to the SP. The SAML-assertion contains statements about the user, including identity and possibly a number of other attributes (see list below). Select the attributes this service requires to operate. For each attribute you request a <strong>valid reason</strong> must be provided which will be reviewed. Note: <strong>every extra attribute you request could complicate the contractual phase</strong>: just one more reason to not select more attributes than you absolutely need. Also note that SURFconext operates with a minimal disclosure principle. This means that only the absolute necessary (personal) information is transferred to a entity. Check this page for more information: <a href=\"https://wiki.surfnet.nl/x/xcpWAw\">https://wiki.surfnet.nl/x/xcpWAw</a>.</p>

<p>Possibly some boxes have already been checked. This information is reused from the metadata.</p>

<p><i>Identity Providers will be informed about the attributes your service requests and must agree to the release of these attributes to your entity.</i></p>
